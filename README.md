## Overview

**Planning Poker (Scrum Poker)** is a popular method for estimating tasks in Agile software development teams. It is a collaborative and gamified approach where team members use a deck of cards with numerical values to assign estimates to different tasks.

The purpose of **Planning Poker** is to facilitate discussion and achieve a consensus-based estimation that considers the expertise and perspectives of all team members. It helps teams prioritize and plan their work effectively during Agile project management.
